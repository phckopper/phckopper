### Hi there 👋 I'm Pedro!

I'm a **computer engineer** based in Brazil/Ireland, currently working at **Qualcomm**. I love to thinker around building my projects, especially those embedded-related. 

During my spare time, I also operate an **amateur radio station** under the callsign **PY3PK**, **EI7JVB** and **M0PHK** :satellite:

👨🏻‍💻  **About Me**
- 🔭 I'm currently working as a **CPU Post-Silicon Power Engineer** @ [Qualcomm](https://qualcomm.com/), characterizing and optimizing the power consumption of the latest-gen mobile Snapdragon SoCs. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying **high-performance computing** and **computer architecture**, focusing mostly on **heterogeneous architectures** and **low-energy designs**. In my spare time, I also research **microarchitectural vulnerabilities** and **digital design**.
- :memo:  In the past, I worked as an **Associate Software Developer** @ [Canonical](https://canonical.com), researching power and performance optimizations for new Intel platforms. I've also worked with **PCB design** and **firmware development** (**STM32**/**NRF52832**) for personal projects and done research on **fault tolerance** at the Embedded Systems Laboratory @ UFRGS. Finally, I've worked on **IoT** devices at [Beyond Domotics](https://beyond.dm/), [DeepX](https://www.deepx.it/) and [balena](https://balena.io), developing both software (**MQTT**/**InfluxDB**/**Grafana**/**Python**/**Typescript**/**Embedded Linux**) and hardware (**KiCad**/**ESP8266**/**Variscite SOMs**) professionally.
